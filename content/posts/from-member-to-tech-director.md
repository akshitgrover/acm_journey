There are a lot of things which I want to talk about my joruney at ACM VIT. But, this post is only about one.

ACM VIT Realises your potential, It brings the best in you, It gives you numerous opportunities, It gives you the space to try and fail, It helps you learn from them and that one thing which this post holds is that "ACM VIT always has a plan for you if you are ready to do what it takes".

My mentors elected me as the Technical director, They carved to become one.
