description: "I was never so thoughtful of myself. I never thought I could address and take sessions, hands on workshops at a gathering of hundreds, and what not. I never thought I could work on and create full scale projects. I never thought I could lead someone."

I was just an average student in my school. I was never given any kind of opportunities or let's just say I never held up for them myself because I always thought so low of myself.
Who to blaim? Me or the teachers? that is the question for some other day.

But, What I know is, Every person deserves a chance and little external help to push the boundaries.

Once I joined ACM VIT, I got the chance to explore what is there for me and ofcourse I had amazing mentors to guide me.

I was never so thoughtful of myself.
I never thought I could address and take sessions, hands on workshops at a gathering of hundreds, and what not.
I never thought I could work on and create full scale projects.
I never thought I could lead someone.

Well, it will always be ***"I never thought"*** for an average student.

ACM VIT taught me **"I believe"**
