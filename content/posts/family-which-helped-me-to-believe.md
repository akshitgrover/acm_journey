Believing was one of the most important things I learnt during my years at ACM VIT.
Often, We tend to reject a task which seems difficult. Difficulty is nothing but a guard which ensures to keep us into our comfort zones.

But we all know no one has ever achieved anything by staying behind the guards of difficulty.

There is only one way one can fight this and get out of the comfort zone, `Believing`.

Believing in a better future.
Believing in something greater than ourselves.
Believing in accomplishments.
Believing in us.

Once we realise that the task upon us is something bigger than me or you or anyone in this world, This is where the key out of the comfort zone lies.

ACM VIT ***"Believes in challenging ones own self"***.
