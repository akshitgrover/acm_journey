I was always a responsible one. But, I was never given the responsibility of let's say a task which has no margin for errors.

What is the meaning of being responsible when one cannot take the responsiblity of an important task. Stressful situations, Kepping track of every thing, Solving internal disputes, Laying out plans, Assigning duties etc. I never tested myself on being responsible for anything at such scale.

I never doubted myself for taking up any task up for a lead.

At ACM VIT I was a part of many teams, I had a say in organising events, Leading projects etc. Had I not been given these chances I could never turn out to be someone who people can look up to get things done, can trust my decisions.

All these years of being a member of ACM VIT, It shaped me into a better me.
