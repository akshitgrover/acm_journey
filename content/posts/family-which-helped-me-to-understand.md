Soon after weeks into my freshmen year I realised, There is a lot to catch up.
I knew nothing compared to others in my batch, Let's not talk about senior batches, They were way up!

I used to sit for hours staring at my computer screen probably going through some tutorials. I was a Hostel -> Lecture & Lecture -> Hostel guy. Always stayed out from any of my roommates plans.

It was second semester when I joined ACM VIT. My college life completely changed there after.

I started hanging out with other members, We used to go out for lunch wearing ACM Tshirts, We used to plan well for our weekends and our night meetings were LIT.

Even work seemed like partying at ACM VIT. We even named our hostel rooms as `ACM VIT Datacenter`, `ACM VIT Headquarters`

All these moments made me realise the importance of friendship, importance of fun, importance of living.
