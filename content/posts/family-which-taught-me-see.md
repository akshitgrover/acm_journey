I always thought of myself as a runner in a 100m race, Running alone to win.

Up till my early days of sophomore year I used to work on projects, ideas etc. as team of one. Things changed when I got my first project, It was a project which required a team of two one for frontend and on to handle the backend part.

This was my first team project. After a few days into development of the project, I could figure out why it always takes a team to build something great.

Working on that project, Handling last moment crisis during an event and many more incidents made me realise the importance of aiming for something which is greater than an individual, something which is bigger than us.

Had I not been a part of this wonderful family I could never have figured out the importance of a team and what it takes to achieve ones goals. All these moments of cohesion and sense of dependability and craving for the end result plunged me to think and see beyond my owns self.
