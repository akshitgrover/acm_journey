We live in era where no one cares about our talents if we cannot present.
We need to present ourselves, We need to show them what we hold.

I was never considerate about showing someone what I can do, I always believed if I know something then that is enough. But, I was very wrong.

VIT has taught me many things and one of them is "Knowing things is not enough and never will be".

At ACM VIT I got the chance to improve upon this ordeal of mine. I had present my projects my ideas to the team. I had to prove I am the guy.
These opportunities which I was given to present were the key to overcome my fear of presentation.

I took various workshops, various sessions, various GDs and various other things.  All of these collectively, Shaped me into a better presenter.

ACM VIT "Believes presentation is as important as gaining knowledge". These two skills should always go hand in hand.
